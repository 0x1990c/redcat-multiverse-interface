      "The Royal College said it couldn’t be done. His head was too in the clouds, they said. Not tethered to the realities and limitations of science, they said. “Poppycock,” Wells said to that, and promptly proved all of them wrong by building his very own functioning time machine, and then not letting any of them try it out.",
      "The plaque in front of his Victorian London laboratory reads Horatio Wells, Inventor & Gentleman.Wells’ birth name is actually Hayden, but he thinks Horatio is more befitting a gentleman time - adventurer.Born to a good family, all his wealthy parents wanted for him was a proper education in the sciences, which he met when he took them to see their first dinosaurs.Though Wells is absent much of the time, he never seems to miss anything important – a benefit of being a time traveler.",
      "The freedom provided by adventuring in time is what Wells treasures most, the ability to pick up and go anywhen he fancies.His natural curiosity draws him to all kinds of places, many of which are of no particular historical importance.Naturally, the future is of significant interest to Wells, but he still doesn’t understand how causality works there in relation to him.",
      "Like many scientists, Wells is fascinated by the mathematics of music.The digital music of the future is of particular interest to him, with its perfect timing and clockwork- like assembly.To him, it’s technology taking people beyond their limits, an example of what he himself pursues."

      "Wells sat down with the lads in the warm and richly appointed Gentleman's Club, a servant following him with warmed brandy in tow. As usual, the hawkish Jones-Smythe sat half-reading, half-participating in the conversation, this time something anatomy-related. The portly Bigglesworth’s cheeks were rosy, as he’d been in his cups longer than the others. Paddington, with his boyish charm, greeted Wells with a warm smile and a toast of his snifter.",
      "“Wells, my good man! Welcome home.Sit and tell us of your travels!”",
      "Wells sat down gingerly, as the wound on his posterior was still fresh. “I’ve just come in from the Jurassic Era.”",
      "“Seems you brought something home with you,” said Jones - Smythe, gesturing towards Wells’ discomfort.",
      "“Yes,” said Wells, settling in. “It seems our current understanding of dinosaurs is wrong in many ways.I can assure you that some of them are much faster than previously expected, with sharper teeth.”",
      "Bigglesworth chortled. “You’re saying one of those buggers bit you square on the arse ?”",
      "“Not in those words, but yes,” responded Wells. “Before that, my journey forward was quite peaceful.I brought some more music of the future.Would you like to hear it ?”",
      "“As long as it’s not that chaotic jazz again,” said Paddington. “Too much improvisation for my tastes.”",
      "“No, it’s not,” said Wells, producing a glowing palm - sized device from his pocket.He activated the curious thing and sound began to pour out from it, a fast, hard, driving music with exploding sounds.Wells frowned and touched the device again. “Sorry, that was a music called drum and bass.Let me find something simpler.”",
      "Bigglesworth snorted in his drink. “I hear neither drum nor bass, man! It sounds like tin cans in a storm and unhealthy flatulence.”",
      "“You, sir, are drunk.” said Wells, as he again activated the music device, this time playing a slower, more mechanical song.The group listened with interest as the piece evolved, adding perfectly timed layers of sound as it progressed, never slowing down.",
      "Paddington sat in astonishment. “Can a human percussionist have the endurance necessary to complete such a feat as this?”",
      "“No,” responded Wells. ”This is a machine which has been instructed what and how to play by a human.”",
      "“Automated music ?” said Paddington. “Not unlike player pianos ?”",
      "Wells shut off the device. “That would be a gross under - simplification, but yes.”",
      "Jones - Smythe paused long enough to poke his nose out from behind his book. “All of this nonsense.Those sounds are unnatural and assault the delicate ears.No one will ever listen to that.”",
      "“Um, Jonesy,” Paddington said. “You forget.Our good man here has brought this music from the future.It is elementary logic to deduce that people must listen to it.”",
      "Jones - Smythe scoffed. “If that’s the future, I am relieved I will be long dead of natural causes before it arrives.”",
      "“You, sir, are a party pooper and lack imagination,” said Wells. “Go back to your body parts.”",
      "Bigglesworth belched loudly in approval. “By the gods, man, that last bit wasn’t too shabby.Show us what else you’ve got!”"

      "Time travel is also space travel, as galaxies, solar systems, and planets do not stay in the same location in space over time.",
      "One of the best known time - travel paradoxes is the Grandfather Paradox.The basic idea is that if you traveled back in time and killed your grandfather, how could you ever have been born to do it in the first place?",
      "Tachyons are theoretical particles which can move faster - than - light, which aren’t consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them.There are those who posit they have the ability to move through time, making them a staple of science - fiction.",
      "In digital music production, the ability to automatically align notes so they are rhythmically perfect is called quantizing."
