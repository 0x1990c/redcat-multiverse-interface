      "The Royal College said it couldn’t be done. His head was too in the clouds, they said. Not tethered to the realities and limitations of science, they said. “Poppycock,” Wells said to that, and promptly proved all of them wrong by building his very own functioning time machine, and then not letting any of them try it out.",
      "The plaque in front of his Victorian London laboratory reads Horatio Wells, Inventor & Gentleman. Wells’ birth name is actually Hayden, but he thinks Horatio is more befitting a gentleman time-adventurer. Born to a good family, all his wealthy parents wanted for him was a proper education in the sciences, which he met when he took them to see their first dinosaurs. Though Wells is absent much of the time, he never seems to miss anything important – a benefit of being a time traveler.",
      "The freedom provided by adventuring in time is what Wells treasures most, the ability to pick up and go anywhere he fancies. His natural curiosity draws him to all kinds of places, many of which are of no particular historical importance. Naturally, the future is of significant interest to Wells, but he still doesn’t understand how causality works there in relation to him.",
      "Like many scientists, Wells is fascinated by the mathematics of music. The digital music of the future is of particular interest to him, with its perfect timing and clockwork-like assembly. To him, it’s technology taking people beyond their limits, an example of what he himself pursues."

      "Wells sat down with the lads in the warm and richly appointed Gentleman's Club, a servant following him with warmed brandy in tow. As usual, the hawkish Jones-Smythe sat half-reading, half-participating in the conversation, this time something anatomy-related. The portly Bigglesworth’s cheeks were rosy, as he’d been in his cups longer than the others. Paddington, with his boyish charm, greeted Wells with a warm smile and a toast of his snifter.",
      "“Wells, my good man! Welcome home. Sit and tell us of your travels!”",
      "Wells sat down gingerly, as the wound on his posterior was still fresh. “I’ve just come in from the Jurassic Era.”",
      "“Seems you brought something home with you,” said Jones-Smythe, gesturing towards Wells’ discomfort.",
      "“Yes,” said Wells, settling in. “It seems our current understanding of dinosaurs is wrong in many ways. I can assure you that some of them are much faster than previously expected, with sharper teeth.”",
      "Bigglesworth chortled. “You’re saying one of those buggers bit you square on the arse?”",
      "“Not in those words, but yes,” responded Wells. “Before that, my journey forward was quite peaceful. I brought some more music of the future. Would you like to hear it?”",
      "“As long as it’s not that chaotic jazz again,” said Paddington. “Too much improvisation for my tastes.”",
      "“No, it’s not,” said Wells, producing a glowing palm-sized device from his pocket. He activated the curious thing and sound began to pour out from it, a fast, hard, driving music with exploding sounds. Wells frowned and touched the device again. “Sorry, that was a music called drum and bass. Let me find something simpler.”",
      "Bigglesworth snorted in his drink. “I hear neither drum nor bass, man! It sounds like tin cans in a storm and unhealthy flatulence.”",
      "“You, sir, are drunk.”, said Wells, as he again activated the music device, this time playing a slower, more mechanical song. The group listened with interest as the piece evolved, adding perfectly timed layers of sound as it progressed, never slowing down.",
      "Paddington sat in astonishment. “Can a human percussionist have the endurance necessary to complete such a feat as this?”",
      "“No,” responded Wells. “This is a machine which has been instructed what and how to play by a human.”",
      "“Automated music?” said Paddington. “Not unlike player pianos?”",
      "Wells shut off the device. “That would be a gross under-simplification, but yes.”",
      "Jones-Smythe paused long enough to poke his nose out from behind his book. “All of this nonsense. Those sounds are unnatural and assault the delicate ears. No one will ever listen to that.”",
      "“Um, Jonesy,” Paddington said. “You forget. Our good man here has brought this music from the future. It is elementary logic to deduce that people must listen to it.”",
      "Jones-Smythe scoffed, “If that’s the future, I am relieved I will be long dead of natural causes before it arrives.”",
      "“You, sir, are a party pooper and lack imagination,” said Wells. “Go back to your body parts.”",
      "Bigglesworth belched loudly in approval. “By the gods, man, that last bit wasn’t too shabby. Show us what else you’ve got!”"

      "Plikplik is a small, furry creature from the harsh world of Proxima Centauri b, in the Alpha Centauri system. Surviving on fairly tasteless root vegetables, these small, furry creatures were constantly testy and fighting with each other, inspiring Plikplik to leave home and search the stars for a way to unite his people. It was on his travels that he discovered all the wondrous food the cosmos had to offer. Upon returning home, Plikplik prepared a summit with an accompanying feast, where his people quickly found peace under the spell of his novel culinary delights.",
      "Since then, Plikplik has once again begun to wander the cosmos in pursuit of his passion for cooking. Despite the tasteless diet of their home, Plikplik’s people actually have one of the most developed palates in the multiverse, making him an ideal chef for many of the greatest gourmands with his ability to draw out hidden flavors of his ingredients.",
      "Despite having tasted all wonders of the galaxy and having cooked for cosmic kings, Plikplik prefers to prepare vegetarian meals in honor of his peoples’ newfound peace. There's no need for anyone to panic if he licks them (which he sometimes does), because his tongue is surprisingly smooth and smells like fresh vanilla."

Mrs. Chen-Irfan was very clear in her expectations for this benefit dinner, and she was known to be unpleasant when things didn’t go according to plan. Chef Rudy looked at the clock, while realizing no one had even started the canapes yet.",
      "He swore, looking around to see if anyone could start the job, but everyone was cooking their little hearts out. As if on cue, a bluish rodent-like creature wearing a big smile came floating through the door at about chest height. The creature saluted Chef Rudy, nodded to the other chefs, and promptly went madly to work on the canapes at a frantic pace. Despite the intense oddity of the situation, Chef Rudy shouted, “Back to work!” He was more afraid of Mrs. Chen-Irfan than whoever or whatever this was.",
      "Minutes later, the diminutive floating creature handed canapes to Chef Rudy to taste. They melted in his mouth, introducing him to flavors he didn’t know those ingredients had. “Keep going,” he said, finishing off the delicacy with a thumbs up. The creature dove back in, just as Mrs. Chen-Irfan entered the kitchen.",
      "“You are behind schedule! What are you doing to make up time?” she said before looking up and seeing the flying rodent. “My goodness! I do not believe THAT,” she said, pointing at the creature, “was part of the vetting process! Get whatever it is out of here now!”",
      "“Believe me, maam,” Chef Rudy said, “I wouldn't normally recommend accepting food from what I think is a strange extraterrestrial being, especially not one which stands about knee high and is that particular shade of puce, but in this case you should make an exception.”",
      "Standing in disbelief, Mrs. Chen-Irfan said, “You seem awfully calm about all of this nonsense.”",
      "“You will be too after you try the canapes. They are truly out of this world,” said Chef Rudy, as the creature finished rescuing the canapes. “You’re welcome in my kitchen anytime, little buddy.” The being floated to shoulder height and raised his hand, engaging Chef Rudy in an enthusiastic high five. Then he floated out the door, with the satisfaction of a job well-done.",
      "Mrs. Chen-Irfan finally tried one of the canapes in protest, and nearly passed out because it was so good."

      "The mystical dragons of Asia have always had natures which tie them to the multiverse, and the primary reason they are rarely seen is because they are often traveling through parallel Earths. One such dragon, Fu Yijun, is a dragon of wisdom who has tied himself to the season of Spring, and has a special interest in the development of life.",
      "Fu Yijun enjoys watching everything, from plants, to people, to communities, grow and become their true selves. He doesn’t concern himself with destinations or endings, because all life ends up in the same place eventually, but rather how a being lives the journey between birth and death. To Fu Yijun, every moment is precious and living in the moment is a gift. He has an easy way about him, with great patience for all things young and new, and enjoys conversing with just about anyone. Though fearsome and powerful in appearance, those who encounter him leave with a lighter heart.",
      "Fu Yijun’s wisdom has been accumulated through thousands of years of personal experience, but also from hearing the stories and lives of beings from all over the multiverse. Knowing that judgment is useless in the grand scheme, he listens without it. An important component of wisdom is seeing the world through the experience of others, for going by only one’s own provides an extremely limited understanding. While Fu Yijun has a better perspective on life than most sentient beings, he’s not attached to the advice he gives. He ultimately believes that people should do what they believe is right for them, as long as it is within the realms of civility and decency.",
      "The only thing which tests Fu Yijun’s patience is deliberate ignorance. He cannot abide those who intentionally choose to remain uneducated about important things, especially those who loudly and boldly voice an opinion on things they know nothing about. While Fu Yijun does his best to help people on the road to understanding, he will leave a situation with someone who clings to their ignorance like it is justified."

      "“It’s always work with you, little one,” Fu Yijun said. “One of these days, mind you I do not expect it soon, we will share time untainted by duty. In the meantime, tell me more about what you mean.”",
      "The cat sniffed at a budding red flower. “In my time and place, we were unafraid to dispense harsh justice. The worst criminals were forced into servitude or publicly executed, and even the lesser ones faced beatings or losing a body part to remind them. People were afraid to break the law. There is none of that here.”",
      "“Things have changed in many places on Earth, in present time,” said Fu Yijun, lighting on a nearby banister. “Many judgments are no longer quite so pitiless.”",
      "“So criminals are more emboldened to offend, because the sentence is bearable,” replied Jendayi, with the cat equivalent of a sigh. “What is your perspective on this? Which ways are correct?”",
      "The diminutive dragon furrowed his brow. “I can’t answer that particular question, but I have come to learn that the reasons people engage in antisocial behavior are often complex. The amount of insight required to understand them is significant, and each offender may need different treatment for rehabilitation. I’ve often found that simple punishment does little to remove the root causes of criminal activity.”",
      "“Isn’t punishment essential? They must be made to feel the suffering they have caused,” said Jendayi.",
      "“First,” said Fu Yijun, “they must be taught empathy. Suffering will organically follow, once they fully realize the impact of their actions.”",
      "Jendayi paused thoughtfully for a moment. “What of those who cannot feel empathy? Scientists have many names for them now.”",
      "“That,” Fu Yijun replied, “is something I do not yet have the wisdom to speak on.”",

They ask a lot of questions to the people they meet, sometimes focusing on strange details or the events leading up to the conversation.While unusual, Cato’s lines of questioning are always innocent, and any social faux pas they commit are entirely by accident.

You are under the misapprehension that individuality is somehow important. It creates division and conflict within a species.We know this from experience. Within Unity, all are equal and lack nothing, and there is no division and no anti-social behavior.”",
      "“Interesting. Let’s take you, B07-161084. You have a name and experience the world independently of the others. While that all becomes part of the collective, you, B07-161084, experience those things first,” said Cato. “Doesn’t that make you unique in some way? Doesn’t that speak to some kind of agency?”",
