            Inspired by the Loot project, Meerkat Bag NFTs are utility NFTs which provide building block primitives, upon which a foundational asset class can be built within the RedCat Multiverse.Meerkat Bags provide an opportunity to start with the content, before moving to gameplay, which in turn creates a purpose- driven community, rather than a product.Meerkat Bags are a collection of 888 NFTs, which have a unique combination of four character traits such as power skills, positive personality traits, even personality traits, and quirky traits.`

            Meerkat Bags essentially provide a prompt or building block primitive - upon which a foundational Multiverse asset Genius can be built.Meerkat Bags are exclusively created for hyper social RedCat Multiverse community members.
