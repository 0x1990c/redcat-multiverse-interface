When you’re ready to enter the multiverse, you can enter one of the portals which lead to adventure."

      "The way our schools work is left over from the Industrial Revolution, when people needed to be taught skills which would prepare them for the newly-minted factory workplace. People have improved on it since then, the world is undergoing another profound shift, which traditional education has yet to fully adopt.",
      "Automation is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the workplace, so the skills people need to prosper professionally are changing again.People are becoming more valuable for their ability to assess and make good decisions, as well as their ability to effectively communicate, and the Red Cat Multiverse will help you hone those skills.",
      "Part of the RedCat Multiverse play experience revolves around story- based campaigns, each set in a different part of the multiverse.You’ll delve into an immersive environment, in which you’ll engage in situations which teach different power skills wrapped up in an exciting story.The more campaigns you play, the more skilled you become, and you’ll earn learning certificate NFTs as you do.For more, click here(links to Whitepaper)."

    comment: "So, I hear your schools are still influenced by the Industrial Revolution. The structure was originally set up to help people prepare to work in factories. Automation, like me, is growing, so education has to shift  again. Being able to effectively reason, observe, and communicate are things machines can’t do, except for me, so those skills are becoming critical for the new world. As you explore the multiverse, you’ll meet people who can help you prepare to be even more awesome in the days ahead!"

      "Your NFTs are your gateway into the multiverse! Every Red Cat Multiverse NFT is an in-game asset, for you to use and develop. In addition to their in-game value, your NFTs have real world value in cryptocurrency! Characters also come in several rarities, which also affect their overall value, making the few Legendary characters in the game special. There are also customizations and items which can only be earned, making them valuable flex, or valuable assets in the marketplace.",
      "Using the RedCat Multiverse’s own marketplace(coming soon in Q3) or a public Marketplace OpenSea, you can buy or sell NFT assets with the rest of the Red Cat Multiverse using popular cryptocurrencies.Once the total supply of NFTs have been sold, the majority of assets in the marketplace will come from you and other players, making you even more essential to the community!",
      "In addition to the marketplace, the Red Cat Multiverse has a trading post where you can trade assets with other players instead of involving a currency transaction.It’s a powerful place to learn negotiation!"

    comment: "Good news! Sanura wants you to be as motivated as possible, so there are plenty of opportunities to stay engaged and earn while learning. As your characters grow and develop, they’ll become more valuable as an in-game asset. This makes them more valuable when you want others in the community to enjoy them, selling or trading their NFTs in the Multiversal Marketplace for real world cryptocurrency. Same goes for things you can use to dress up your characters, to help them be more unique. You’ll also be earning Alarium Crystals, which you can use to acquire things to help you and your friends along the way."
