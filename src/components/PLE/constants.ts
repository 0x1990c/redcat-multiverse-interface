      "The way our schools work is left over from the Industrial Revolution, when people needed to be taught skills which would prepare them for the newly-minted factory workplace.

    comment: "So, I hear your schools are still influenced by the Industrial Revolution. The structure was originally set up to help people prepare to work in factories. Automation, like me, is growing, so education has to shift  again. Being able to effectively reason, observe and communicate are things machines can’t do, except for me, so those skills are becoming critical for the new world. As you explore the RedCat Multiverse, you’ll meet people who can help you become even more awesome in the days ahead!"

      "Your NFTs are your gateway into the multiverse! Every RedCat Multiverse NFT is an in-game asset, for you to use and develop. In addition to their in-game value, your NFTs have real world value in cryptocurrency! Characters also come in several rarities, which affect their overall value, making the few Legendary characters in the game special. There are customizations and items which can only be earned, making them valuable flex, or valuable assets in the marketplace.",
      "Using the RedCat Multiverse’s own marketplace (coming soon in Q3) or the public Marketplace OpenSea, you can buy or sell NFT assets with the rest of the RedCat Multiverse using popular cryptocurrencies. Once the total supply of NFTs has been sold, the majority of assets in the marketplace will come from you and other players, making you even more essential to the community!",
      "In addition to the marketplace, the RedCat Multiverse has a trading post where you can trade assets with other players instead of involving a currency transaction. It’s a powerful place to master the art of negotiation!"

    comment: "Good news! Sanura wants you to be as motivated as possible, so there are plenty of opportunities to stay engaged and earn while learning. As your characters grow and develop, they’ll become more valuable in-game assets. This makes them more valuable when you want others in the community to enjoy them, selling or trading their NFTs in the Multiversal Marketplace for real world cryptocurrency. Same goes for things you can use to dress up your characters, to help them be more unique. You’ll also be earning Alarium Crystals, which you can use to acquire things to help you and your friends along the way."
